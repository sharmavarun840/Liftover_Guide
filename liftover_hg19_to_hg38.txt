The process of changing the coordinates in the BIM file (plink format) from hg19 to hg38 is indeed referred to as "liftover."

1. Ensure you have your PLINK files (bed, bim, fam) ready for liftover.

#Extract the coordinates from the BIM file: (This .bed file is different than plink bed file, beware of this)

awk '{print "chr"$1, $4, $4+1, $2}' OFS="\t" input.bim > hg19.bed

2. Download the chain file for hg19 to hg38:

wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/liftOver/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz

gunzip hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz





3. Download the liftOver executable from UCSC:

wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/liftOver

chmod +x liftOver

4. Run liftOver to convert the coordinates

./liftOver hg19.bed hg19ToHg38.over.chain hg38.bed unlifted.bed

5. Extract new positions from hg38.bed:

awk '{print $4, $2}' OFS="\t" hg38.bed > new_positions.txt

6. Create a new BIM file with updated positions:
awk 'NR==FNR{a[$1]=$2; next} {if ($2 in a) $4=a[$2]; print}' OFS="\t" new_positions.txt input.bim > input_hg38.bim

7. Update the Final PLINK file conversion (change the name of .bed and .fam)

cp input.bed input_hg38.bed
cp input.fam input_hg38.fam
